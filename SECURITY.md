## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of zodkit seriously. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to the maintainers via:
   - GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
   - Direct message to project maintainers

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Within 30 days for critical issues

### Security Update Process

1. The reported issue will be confirmed and analyzed
2. A fix will be developed and tested
3. A security advisory will be prepared
4. The fix will be released as soon as possible
5. Credit will be given to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested)

## Security Best Practices

When using zodkit in your projects:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update zodkit and its dependencies
2. **Validate Configurations**: Ensure your Zod schemas are properly configured
3. **Limit File System Access**: Be cautious with file patterns and paths
4. **Review Generated Code**: Always review any code generated by zodkit
5. **Use Latest Stable Version**: Avoid using pre-release versions in production

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Access
zodkit requires file system access to read and validate files. Ensure:
- File patterns are restricted to intended directories
- Sensitive files are excluded from validation
- Configuration files are properly secured

### Schema Validation
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Use strict schema definitions
- Avoid dynamic schema generation from untrusted sources

### Dependencies
zodkit relies on several third-party packages. We:
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Use `npm audit` in our CI/CD pipeline

## Security Features

zodkit includes several security features:

- **Input Validation**: All configurations are validated with Zod schemas
- **Path Sanitization**: File paths are sanitized before access
- **No Code Execution**: zodkit only analyzes code, never executes it
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security audits of dependencies

## Contact

For any security concerns or questions, please contact the maintainers through GitHub.
